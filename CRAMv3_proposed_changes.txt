1. New read features:
Code	Data type	Data series	Description
A	byte[], byte[]	BA, QS	a stretch of bases and quality scores
b	byte[]	BA	a stretch of bases
q	byte[]	QS	a stretch of quality scores

2. Allow compression on the file header block. 

3. Block compression methods: 
   1. raw: method id=0
   2. gzip: method id=1
   3. bzip2*: method id=2
   4. lzma**: method id=3
   5. rans**: method id=4
   
   * - existed but not supported
   ** - new methods

4. Checksums:
   1. Append CRC32 to container header
   2. Append CRC32 to block

Note: this changes the EOF marker to: 
0f 00 00 00 ff ff ff ff 0f e0 45 4f 46 00 00 00 00 01 00 8b d7 72 2f 00 01 00 06 06 01 00 01 00 01 00 ee 63 01 4b

5. New codecs:
   1. INTERLEAVED, id=10
   This is to allow bytes from multiple data series to be mixed together in one block. 
   		Arguments: cycle length and index in the cycle.
   2. DEMULTIPLEXED, id=11
   To store bytes of a data series in multiple blocks, for example 2-byte int could be split between high-byte block and low-byte block. 
		Arguments: block ids

6. Frequency tables:
   1. Order 0: alphabet + array of frequencies
   2. Order 1: alphabet + gamma encoded frequencies of all combinations by 2
   
   Alphabet encoding options: 
   Option 1: 
   Xn RLE: first value followed by nof increments, so for example range A-Z is written as 0x41 0x19
   Option 2: 
   ABn RLE: two symbols followed by repeat count implying equidistant symbols follow. 
   Option 2:
   <count><alphabet bytes>
   
   Frequency table encoding: 
   Option 1: itf8
   Option 2: gamma
   Option 3: rans
