1. New read features:
Code	Data type	Data series	Description
A	byte[], byte[]	BA, QS	a stretch of bases and quality scores
b	byte[]	BA	a stretch of bases
q	byte[]	QS	a stretch of quality scores

2. Allow compression on the file header block. 

3. Block compression methods: 
   1. raw: method id=0
   2. gzip: method id=1
   3. bzip2: method id=2
   4. lzma: method id=3
   5. rans: method id=4

4. Checksums:
   1. Append CRC32 to container header
   2. Append CRC32 to block

Note: this changes the EOF marker to: 
0f 00 00 00 ff ff ff ff ff e0 45 4f 46 00 00 
00 00 01 00 69 ad 1a c6

5. New codecs:
   1. INTERLEAVED, id=10
   2. DEMULTIPLEXED, id=11

6. Frequency tables:
   1. Order 0: alphabet + array of frequencies as itf8
   2. Order 1: alphabet + gamma encoded frequencies of all combinations by 2
   
   Alphabets are encoded using RLE: first value followed by nof increments, so for example range A-Z is written as 0x41 0x19
